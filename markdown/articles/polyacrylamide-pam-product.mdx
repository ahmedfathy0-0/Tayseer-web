## PAM | Polyacrylamide

As a major polyacrylamide supplier in Egypt, TSC provides anionic and cationic polyacrylamide to satisfy the needs of the Egyptian water and wastewater treatment market.

## Forms of Polyacrylamide (PAM)

**Anionic Polyacrylamide** has a high molecular weight, low charge density polymer, which works as a flocculant to enhance liquid-solids separation processes. It can be used to improve oil separation in industrial wastewater by enhancing air flotation units and clarification processes.

**Cationic Polyacrylamide** has a high molecular weight, high charge density, and cationic polymer, which enhances sludge dewatering aid in the liquid-solid separation process and acts as a flocculant in clarification, air flotation, and dewatering systems.
