## Applications of Polyaluminium Chloride (PAC 18)

- It serves as an efficient coagulant in both water and wastewater treatment processes, aiding in the clarification and purification of various water types, including drinking water, sewage, and industrial wastewater.
- In papermaking, PAC 18 functions as a retention aid agent along with the sizing agent, enhancing paper strength and quality.
- It holds potential applications in the oil and gas sector, where it can be used as a coagulant for produced water treatment.

## Benefits of Polyaluminium Chloride (PAC 18)

- It enhances water quality compared to other traditional chemicals
- It has lower dosages compared to other traditional chemicals
- It has a wide pH range, so mostly no need for pH pre-adjustment
- It has a slight effect on pH after treatment, so mostly no need for pH post-adjustment
- It results in lower sludge volume production, which enhances sludge handling
- It reduces the settling time as flocs produced settle quickly
